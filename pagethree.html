      <h1>Know your Big Three? The stars send their selections</h1>
      <p>Not to disappoint, but it's actually me — a mere mortal — who makes these song selections. As a Gemini rising, Capricorn sun and Taurus moon, I feel as though I have the right combination of skills to do this task (and clearly the right touch of insanity to undertake it). Again, no true methodology — just vibes.</p>
      <p><em>For this page, I have not made the individual playlists because I hope that using some java script we learn I can assign songs from the playlists I've already made a category of sun, moon or rising in each sign. And then the computer can make all the different combinations since... there are 1720 different sun-moon-rising combos. For now, I'll just leave you with my favorite tiny desk concert</em></p>
